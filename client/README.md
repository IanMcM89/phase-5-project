**Note: Usernames and avatars will show above created event markers on the map to all other friends in the area.**

## Friends and Users List

Users of the app can search for a known username using the provided searchbox. If the username exists, the user will show up under the `All Users` tab. Click the add icon to move the user from the `All Users` tab to the `Requested Friends` tab and send the user a friend request.

## Dynamic map powered by [react-google-maps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-google-maps)

The dynamic Google map automatically grabs the user's location via Google's geolocation service. Users can then use the provided searchbox to search the area for places. Click the red marker pin of the desired place to view the address, rating and photos (if provided), then click the `Create Event` button to redirect to the event creation page.

The map shows nearby event markers and overlays for the user as well as for any friend's the user may have with events in the area.

**Note: Markers and overlays are color coded as follows:**

üü© Your Events <br/>
üü¶ Friends' Events <br/>
üü• Search Results <br/>

## Event Creation

Once a location has been chosen on the map, the provided event form will be auto-filled with the name, address and rating of the desired place. A static Google map with a marker showing the place's location is also provided. To complete the form, simply fill in a title, date, time and a brief description of the event you are hosting. Click the "Create Event" button when finished to post the event to your events list.

**Note: Your eventslist is private, but any friends can view your events via the App's map if they are nearby**

## Events List

The events page shows a user all of their current and past events via event cards. Each card shows a snapshot of the event's title, date and a mini map with a marker over the event's location. A user can enter a date and text value into the searchbar to filter results. Text value searches by event title and/or address. To view more information about the event, click the event card to redirect to the event's page.
